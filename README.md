## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />

### Explanation
Everything on the checklist is working as you asked. Messages are rendered when the user scrolls to improve performance, when a message that was "unread" is rendered, it changes to "read", and the counter on the top of the screen displays the updated number. You can also click the button on the side of the "Send a message" input to go to the next unread message.

You can write a new message and send it, the message appears in the chat history with the current timestamp and "sent" status.

The app is fully responsive, you can view it on any device and it will display correctly.

You can see a demo of the app here: https://chat-app-display.now.sh/

The whole project is on Github in a private repository, if you want access please provide a user so I can give it to you.
